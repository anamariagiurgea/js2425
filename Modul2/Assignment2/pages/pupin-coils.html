                <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils",
                    followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and
                    mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some
                    seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the
                    American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone &
                    Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought
                    Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their
                    own development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this
                    point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent.
                    AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which
                    was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the
                    range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.
